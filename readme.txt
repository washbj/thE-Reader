		  ~ The Swellest Reader ~
	~ An App by Team Mostly-Bakesie Tater Forcey ~
The purpose of this app is to bridge the gap between the convenience 
factor of an e-book and the “feel” of an actual book. The app will 
take an input text file and display it in a book-like way, printing 
the words in a fancy font over simulated pages, which can be flipped 
with flick of a finger. Users may also choose to have the book read 
aloud to them.

At the moment, the Swellest Reader is in heavy alpha, and implements 
little more than the minimum desired features. These features include:
 - The capacity to load in a SMALL text file and convert it to  
   pages, which can be flipped through by swiping from side to
   side...just like a real book! :D
 - The capacity to split sentences without splitting the words 
   in them. Hyphens are bad, m'kay.
 - The capacity to create and log into an online account, so as 
   to save things like personalization options.
 - Book titles (at the moment the first thirty characters) are 
   also saved to an online database.

Known Issues:
 - App seems unable to process very large files (upwards of 600 kb).
   Possibly due to inefficient code. We have a plan to fix this, 
   but were unable to implement it before the deliverable due to 
   time constraints.
